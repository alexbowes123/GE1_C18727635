My Idea for my GE 1 project is to create a VR experience
in which the player can move their head to see a space battle above them.

The player will start in a room and instantly see a 
sign on a wall that says "look up". The player will then lift their head
to see that there is no roof on the room and that they can see far out
into space. 

In space they will see 2 opposing space ship armies meeting for battle (similar to star wars).


If a space ship is within range of an enemy they can lock on and chase the enemy.
The user can watch dog fights between opposing spaceships with red and 
green lasers being shot off.

I would love to include a procedural event where the winning army
is not pre determined and equal opportunity is given to each fleet to win.
The user can restart the simulation and the winning fleet may be different each time.
