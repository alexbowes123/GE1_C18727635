This repository is for (C18727635) Alexander Bowes's Games Engines 1 Project 2020/21


My idea for this project is to create a game where the player
controls a delivery man who must deliver as many pizzas as possible
within a time limit.

The delivery man will ride a bicycle and challenge will come from the
player trying to avoid obstacles like moving cars while racing against
the clock.

If the player is hit by a car then they will fall off and have to get back 
onto their bike to resume the delivery.

Score is kept for how many deliveries that are made.

This game idea is inspired by 2 iconic games:
